## AI FUTURE ASSIGNMENT
README – AI Systems Project (2025)
===================================

This repository contains work for a comprehensive AI course project covering theoretical analysis, hands-on implementation, and future-focused design. The goal is to explore real-world uses of AI across Edge computing, IoT, healthcare, and quantum computing—while staying grounded in ethics and impact.

-----------------------------------------------------------
PART 1: THEORETICAL ANALYSIS (40%)
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Essay Questions:

Q1. **Edge AI vs Cloud AI**  
Explains how Edge AI reduces response time and protects user privacy, with a real-world example (autonomous drones).

Q2. **Quantum AI vs Classical AI**  
Compares how quantum computing could outperform classical AI in optimization problems. Discusses which industries (e.g., finance, logistics, pharma) stand to gain most.

Q3. **Human-AI Collaboration in Healthcare**  
Explores how AI is changing the roles of radiologists, nurses, and others—shifting from diagnosis to decision-support and patient interaction.

2. Case Study Critique:

**AI in Smart Cities: AI-IoT for Traffic Management**  
Analyzes how combining AI and IoT helps make cities more efficient and sustainable. Highlights benefits like real-time traffic flow and reduced emissions, as well as challenges like data privacy and infrastructure costs.

-----------------------------------------------------------
PART 2: PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION (50%)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Task 1: **Edge AI Prototype**  
- Trains a small image classifier to recognize recyclable items.  
- Converts model to TensorFlow Lite.  
- Tests real-time inference on a Raspberry Pi or in Colab.  
- Includes code + report with metrics and deployment steps.

Task 2: **AI-Driven Smart Agriculture**  
- Lists sensors needed: soil moisture, temperature, humidity, etc.  
- Proposes a model for predicting crop yields using sensor data.  
- Includes a 1-page proposal and a data flow diagram showing how data moves from sensors to AI predictions.

Task 3: **Ethics in Personalized Medicine**  
- Analyzes bias in AI models trained on the Cancer Genomic Atlas.  
- Focuses on underrepresentation of ethnic groups.  
- Recommends fairness strategies like diverse data, subgroup testing, and interpretable models.  
- Includes a 300-word analysis.

-----------------------------------------------------------
PART 3: FUTURISTIC PROPOSAL (10%)
-----------------------------------------------------------

**AI in 2030: Concept Paper**  
Proposes a bold AI application for the near future—such as neural interfaces, AI-assisted disaster control, or climate repair systems.  
Explains the problem it addresses, the AI workflow (data, model, output), and possible risks and benefits.

-----------------------------------------------------------
BONUS TASK: QUANTUM COMPUTING (10%)
-----------------------------------------------------------

**Quantum AI Simulation with IBM Quantum Experience**  
- Builds a basic quantum circuit using Qiskit.  
- Explains how quantum computing could speed up AI tasks like drug discovery or route optimization.  
- Focuses on simplicity and clarity for newcomers.
