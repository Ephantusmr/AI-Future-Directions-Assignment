Ethics in AI-Powered Personalized Medicine Using the Cancer Genomic Atlas
===========================================================================

Artificial intelligence is transforming personalized medicine, especially in cancer care. 
By analyzing large-scale genomic datasets like The Cancer Genomic Atlas (TCGA), AI can help 
match patients with the treatments most likely to work for them. But without attention to 
ethics and fairness, these systems can unintentionally deepen existing health inequalities.

One major concern is bias in the data. TCGA is heavily weighted toward samples from individuals 
of European ancestry. This means AI models trained on TCGA may perform well for white patients 
but poorly for others, such as Black, Hispanic, Asian, or Indigenous groups. As a result, 
treatment recommendations might be less accurate—or even unsafe—for underrepresented populations. 
Important genetic markers that influence treatment response may go undetected simply because they 
don’t appear often enough in the training data.

Bias isn’t only about race or ethnicity. Socioeconomic status can also skew results. Variables 
like zip code, insurance status, or clinic location may act as proxies for systemic inequities 
and influence how models make decisions.

To address these challenges, several fairness strategies should be used:

1. Diversify training data:
   Work with global institutions and underrepresented communities to collect more balanced 
   genomic and clinical datasets.

2. Bias auditing:
   Regularly evaluate model performance across demographic groups. Flag and correct 
   disparities.

3. Transparency and explainability:
   Use interpretable models so that patients and clinicians understand how recommendations 
   are made.

4. Fairness-aware algorithms:
   Apply training techniques like reweighting or adversarial debiasing to reduce bias in 
   the model itself.

Ethical AI in medicine is not just about accuracy—it’s about equity. These systems must be 
built to serve everyone, not just those already well represented in the data.
